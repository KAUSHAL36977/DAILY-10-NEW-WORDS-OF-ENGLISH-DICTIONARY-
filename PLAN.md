The task involves creating a full-stack application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack based on the provided Python code that generates random words using various libraries. The user wants to create both the backend and frontend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and use MySQL for data storage.

1. **Information Gathered**:
   - The provided code generates random words from NLTK, PyDictionary, and pyenchant.
   - The application should be interactive and reactive, allowing users to interact with the word generation features.
   - The user wants to store data in MySQL, which is not typical for a MERN stack (which usually uses MongoDB). However, I can create a backend that connects to MySQL.

2. **Plan**:
   - **Backend**:
     - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
     - Create API endpoints to handle requests for generating random words and storing/retrieving them from MySQL.
     - Use a MySQL database to store the generated words and their meanings.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Create a React application that interacts with the backend.
     - Design components to display the generated words and allow user interaction.
     - Use CSS for styling the application to make it visually appealing.
   - **Database**:
     - Set up a MySQL database with a table to store words and their meanings.

3. **Dependent Files to be edited**:
   - Backend files: `server.js`, database connection file, and routes for API.
   - Frontend files: React components, CSS files, and main application file.

4. **Followup steps**:
   - Install necessary packages for the backend (Express, MySQL, etc.).
   - Create the database schema.
   - Implement the backend logic.
   - Create the React frontend and connect it to the backend.

I will now proceed to create the backend structure first. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any modifications.
